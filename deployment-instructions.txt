GODADDY HOSTING SETUP FOR EDIBLE EARTH
=====================================

STEP 1: Upload Files
- Log into your GoDaddy cPanel
- Go to File Manager
- Navigate to public_html folder
- Upload ALL files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, all images, .htaccess, .htpasswd)

STEP 2: Password Protection Setup
- The .htaccess file will password protect your site
- Login credentials: username "admin", password "edible2024"
- Visitors must enter these to view the site

STEP 3: Update .htpasswd Path
- In cPanel File Manager, note your full path (usually /home/yourusername/public_html/)
- Edit the .htaccess file and replace "/home/yourusername/public_html/.htpasswd" with your actual path

STEP 4: Test
- Visit edibleearth.co.uk
- You should see a password prompt
- Enter admin/edible2024 to access the site

STEP 5: When Ready to Go Live
- Simply delete or rename the .htaccess file to remove password protection

Note: All images and files are ready for upload. The site uses relative paths so it will work immediately on your domain.
